                                                swim in the direction of the pound; and a pound net that serves as the

                                                The tops of the nets poke out of the surface of the water, making sure
                                                that fish and other animals do not escape. As sea turtles swim parallel
                                                to shore, their path is blocked by the fence-like leader, where their
                                                fins or heads can be entangled, causing serious injury or death from
                                                drowning. Recent studies have shown that decreasing mesh size and
